 We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and the
 other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.

    Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/regex_sum_42.txt (There are 90 values with a sum=445833)
    Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/regex_sum_1597447.txt (There are 84 values and the sum ends with 297)

import re

hand = open("regex_sum_1597447.txt")
a = list()
for line in hand:
     b = re.findall('[0-9]+',line)
     a = a + b

sum = 0
for c in a:
    sum = sum + int(c)

print(sum)
